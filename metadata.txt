description=Shape Tools is all about geodesic shapes and tools. Create ellipse, line of bearing, pie wedge, polygon, star, ellipse rose, hypocyloid, polyfoil, epicycloid, and heart shapes. Implements an "XY to Line" tool. Densify lines and polygons along geodesic paths. Includes geodesic measure tool.

about=Shape Tools is all about geodesic shapes and functions. "Create Shapes" processes a point vector layer to create ellipses, pies, lines of bearing, polygons, stars, ellipse roses, hypocyloids, polyfoils, epicycloids, and hearts based on the table's fields and parameters from the dialog box. "XY to Line" uses pairs of coordinates from each layer's records to create geodesic lines in between. The input can be a point vector layer or a table layer that contains pairs of coordinates. "Line Geodesic Densifier" and "Polygon Geodesic Densifier" create geodesic lines and polygons by adding additional vertices along geodesic paths within the shape. "Geodesic Measure Tool" produces measurements similar to Google Earth. Shape Tools is installed in the Vector menu.
