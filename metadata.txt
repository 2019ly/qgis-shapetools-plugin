about=Shape Tools features geodesic shapes and tools. "Create Shapes" processes a point vector layer to create ellipses, pie wedges, lines of bearing, polygons, stars, ellipse roses, hypocyloids, polyfoils, epicycloids, and hearts based on the table's fields and other parameters. "XY to Line" uses pairs of coordinates from each record to create geodesic lines. "Geodesic Shape Densifier" creates geodesic lines and polygons by adding additional vertices along geodesic paths within the shape. "Geodesic Measure Tool" measures distances using the WGS 84 ellipsoid and includes the bearing or heading between points. It will even saves the measurements as a layer. "Azimuth, Distance Digitizer" digitizes points based on a clicked point, an azimuth and distance or creates a geodesic line from a clicked point to an azimuth and distance. Shape Tools is installed in the Vector menu.
