about='Create Shapes' takes a point vector layer and allows the user to create ellipses, lines of bearing, polygons, and stars based on the table's fields and parameters from the dialog box. All use geodetic math to calculate the shapes. The second tool, 'XY to Line' uses pairs of coordinates from each layer's records to create geodetic lines in between. The input can be a point vector layer or just a table layer that contains pairs of coordinates. Shape Tools is installed in the Vector menu.
