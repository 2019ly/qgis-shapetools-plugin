about="Create Shapes" processes a point vector layer to create ellipses, pies, lines of bearing, polygons, stars, ellipse roses, hypocyloids, polyfoils, epicycloids, and hearts based on the table's fields and parameters from the dialog box. All use geodesic math to calculate the shapes. "XY to Line" uses pairs of coordinates from each layer's records to create geodesic lines inbetween. The input can be a point vector layer or a table layer that contains pairs of coordinates. "Line to Geodesic Line" and "Polygon to Geodesic Polygon" create geodesic lines and polygons by adding additional vertices along geodesic paths withing the shape. Shape Tools is installed in the Vector menu.
