about="Create Shapes" processes a point vector layer to create ellipses, pies, lines of bearing, polygons, stars, ellipse roses, hypocyloids, polyfoils, epicycloids, and hearts based on the table's fields and parameters from the dialog box. All use geodetic math to calculate the shapes. "XY to Line" uses pairs of coordinates from each layer's records to create geodetic lines inbetween. The input can be a point vector layer or a table layer that contains pairs of coordinates. Shape Tools is installed in the Vector menu.
