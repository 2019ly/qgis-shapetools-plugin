about=Shape Tools is all about geodesic shapes and functions. "Create Shapes" processes a point vector layer to create ellipses, pies, lines of bearing, polygons, stars, ellipse roses, hypocyloids, polyfoils, epicycloids, and hearts based on the table's fields and parameters from the dialog box. "XY to Line" uses pairs of coordinates from each layer's records to create geodesic lines in between. The input can be a point vector layer or a table layer that contains pairs of coordinates. "Geodesic Shape Densifier" creates geodesic lines and polygons by adding additional vertices along geodesic paths within the shape. "Geodesic Measure Tool" uses WGS 84 ellipsoid measurements and includes the bearing or heading between points. Shape Tools is installed in the Vector menu.
